    Wraps another sampler to yield a mini-batch of indices.
    It enforces that the batch only contain elements from the same group.
    It also tries to provide mini-batches which follows an ordering which is
    as close as possible to the ordering from the original sampler.

    Arguments:
        sampler (Sampler): Base sampler.
        group_ids (list[int]): If the sampler produces indices in range [0, N),
            `group_ids` must be a list of `N` ints which contains the group id of each sample.
            The group ids must be a continuous set of integers starting from
            0, i.e. they must be in the range [0, num_groups).
        batch_size (int): Size of mini-batch.
