Dense human pose estimation aims at mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of the human body.

In this repository, we provide the code to train and evaluate DensePose-RCNN. We also provide tools to visualize
DensePose annotation and results.

## Training

To train a model one can call
```bash
python /path/to/detectron2/projects/DensePose/train_net.py --config-file <config.yaml>
```

For example, to launch end-to-end DensePose-RCNN training with ResNet-50 FPN backbone on a single GPU,
one should execute:
```bash
python /path/to/detectron2/projects/DensePose/train_net.py --config-file /path/to/detectron2/projects/DensePose/configs/densepose_R_50_FPN_s1x.yaml
```

## Testing

Model testing can be done in the same way as training, except for an additional flag `--eval-only` and
model location specification through `MODEL.WEIGHT model.pth` in the command line
```bash
python /path/to/detectron2/projects/DensePose/train_net.py --config-file /path/to/detectron2/projects/DensePose/configs/densepose_R_50_FPN_s1x.yaml --eval-only MODEL.WEIGHT model.pth
```

## Tools

We provide tools which allow one to:
 - easily view DensePose annotated data in a dataset;
 - perform DensePose inference on a set of images;
 - visualize DensePose model results;

`query_db` is a tool to print or visualize DensePose data in a dataset.
Details on this tool can be found in [`TOOL_QUERY_DB.md`](doc/TOOL_QUERY_DB.md) 

`apply_net` is a tool to print or visualize DensePose results.
Details on this tool can be found in [`TOOL_APPLY_NET.md`](doc/TOOL_APPLY_NET.md)
